            <p>Job interview whiteboard challenges can feel intimidating, but they're actually opportunities to demonstrate exactly the skills employers value most. Here's how to excel in interview settings.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the Interview Context</h2>

            <h3>What Employers Are Really Looking For</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Problem-solving process:</strong> How you break down ambiguous problems</li>
                <li><strong>Communication skills:</strong> Can you explain complex ideas clearly?</li>
                <li><strong>User empathy:</strong> Do you genuinely consider user needs and context?</li>
                <li><strong>Business understanding:</strong> Can you balance user needs with business goals?</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration ability:</strong> How do you handle feedback and build on others' ideas?</li>
                <li><strong>Design judgment:</strong> Do you make thoughtful, defensible decisions?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Interview Challenges</h2>

            <h3>Product Improvement</h3>
            <p>"How would you improve the checkout experience for our mobile app?"</p>

            <h3>New Feature Design</h3>
            <p>"Design a feature to help users share content more easily"</p>

            <h3>Broad Problem Solving</h3>
            <p>"How might we help busy parents eat healthier meals?"</p>

            <h3>Redesign Challenge</h3>
            <p>"Our users say our dashboard is confusing. How would you fix it?"</p>

            <h2>Interview-Specific Strategies</h2>

            <h3>Start with Clarifying Questions</h3>
            <p>This is crucial in interviews because it shows analytical thinking:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Who are the primary users we're designing for?"</li>
                <li>"What specific problems have users reported?"</li>
                <li>"Are there any technical constraints I should consider?"</li>
                <li>"What does success look like for this project?"</li>
                <li>"How much time/budget is available for implementation?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Demonstrate Your Research Instincts</h3>
            <p>Even without access to real users:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"In my experience, users in this situation typically..."</li>
                <li>"I'd want to understand more about how users currently..."</li>
                <li>"Based on similar products I've studied..."</li>
                <li>"I'm assuming X, but I'd validate that by..."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Work at the Right Level of Fidelity</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with concepts and user flows, not pixel-perfect mockups</li>
                <li>Show multiple approaches before diving deep on one</li>
                <li>Focus on the thinking behind decisions, not visual polish</li>
                <li>Save detailed design for the most important screens or moments</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Managing the Interview Dynamic</h2>

            <h3>Include Your Observers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask for their input at key decision points</li>
                <li>Check if your direction makes sense before continuing</li>
                <li>Invite questions throughout, not just at the end</li>
                <li>Acknowledge when they raise good points</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Handle Disagreement Gracefully</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Listen to concerns without getting defensive</li>
                <li>Ask clarifying questions to understand their perspective</li>
                <li>Explain your reasoning while staying open to other views</li>
                <li>Find ways to incorporate their feedback when possible</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Show Your Adaptability</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pivot when given new information or constraints</li>
                <li>Build on suggestions rather than dismissing them</li>
                <li>Demonstrate how you'd approach iteration and testing</li>
                <li>Show enthusiasm for collaboration and feedback</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Discuss Next Steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How would you validate this solution?</li>
                <li>What would you want to test or research further?</li>
                <li>How might this evolve over time?</li>
                <li>What would implementation priorities be?</li>
            </ul>
