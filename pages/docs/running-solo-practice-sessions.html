            <p>Solo practice is where you build the muscle memory and confidence needed for high-stakes whiteboard challenges. Here's how to make your individual sessions as effective as possible.</p>

            <h2>Setting Up for Success</h2>

            <h3>Create the Right Environment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a physical whiteboard or large paper if possible</li>
                <li>Have sticky notes, markers, and sketching materials ready</li>
                <li>Set up a timer to practice working within constraints</li>
                <li>Remove distractions (phone, notifications, etc.)</li>
                <li>Consider recording yourself to review your performance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Choose Your Challenge Mix</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>70% challenges in your target difficulty range</li>
                <li>20% easier challenges to build confidence</li>
                <li>10% harder challenges to stretch your skills</li>
                <li>Mix different categories (branding, UX, marketing) regularly</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Solo Practice Structure</h2>

            <h3>Pre-Challenge (5 minutes)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Review the challenge and set your timer</li>
                <li>Get your materials organized</li>
                <li>Take a deep breath and focus</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>During the Challenge</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Talk out loud through your entire process</li>
                <li>Resist the urge to restart – work with your initial direction</li>
                <li>Note areas where you feel stuck or uncertain</li>
                <li>Push through to completion even if you're not satisfied</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Post-Challenge Review (10 minutes)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Assess your process against the fundamental framework</li>
                <li>Identify specific areas for improvement</li>
                <li>Note what went well and what you'd do differently</li>
                <li>Document insights for future reference</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Advanced Solo Techniques</h2>

            <h3>The Devil's Advocate Method</h3>
            <p>After completing a challenge, argue against your own solution. What would someone critique? How would you respond?</p>

            <h3>Multiple Solutions Approach</h3>
            <p>Set aside extra time to quickly sketch 2-3 alternative solutions after your main one. This builds flexibility and creative confidence.</p>

            <h3>Constraint Variation</h3>
            <p>Take the same challenge and practice it with different time limits or additional constraints to build adaptability.</p>

            <h3>The Teach-Back Method</h3>
            <p>After completing a challenge, explain your solution to an imaginary colleague or client. This builds presentation confidence.</p>

            <h2>Tracking Your Progress</h2>

            <h3>Keep a Practice Journal</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Date and challenge completed</li>
                <li>Key insights or learnings</li>
                <li>Areas that felt difficult</li>
                <li>Solutions or techniques that worked well</li>
                <li>Questions that came up during the process</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Skill-Specific Metrics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Time to understand the problem (aim to improve speed)</li>
                <li>Number of solution alternatives generated</li>
                <li>Clarity of final presentation (record and review)</li>
                <li>Confidence level throughout the process</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Solo Practice Pitfalls</h2>

            <h3>Perfectionism</h3>
            <p>Don't restart challenges when you make mistakes. Learn to work with imperfect starts.</p>

            <h3>Skipping the Hard Parts</h3>
            <p>Practice the parts you're worst at, not just the parts you enjoy.</p>

            <h3>No Time Pressure</h3>
            <p>Always use a timer. Real challenges have deadlines.</p>

            <h3>Working in Isolation</h3>
            <p>Even solo practice benefits from occasional feedback. Share your work with peers or mentors.</p>

            <h2>Weekly Practice Schedule</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monday:</strong> Quick 20-minute branding challenge</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> 45-minute product design challenge</li>

                <li><strong>Weekend:</strong> Longer 60-90 minute complex challenge</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Building Specific Skills</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Focus on problem comprehension and asking good questions</li>
                <li><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> Emphasize research speed and insight generation</li>
                <li><strong>Week 5-6:</strong> Practice ideation quantity and quality</li>
                <li><strong>Week 7-8:</strong> Work on presentation clarity and storytelling</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When You Feel Stuck</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Take a 5-minute break and come back fresh</li>
                <li>Switch to a different part of the problem</li>
                <li>Sketch something, anything, to get unstuck</li>
                <li>Ask yourself: "What would [role model designer] do here?"</li>
                <li>Remember: the goal is learning, not perfection</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Solo practice builds the foundation. The more you practice alone, the more confident and skilled you'll be when others are watching.</p>
