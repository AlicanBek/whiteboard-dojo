        <div class="doc-content">
            <p>A whiteboard challenge is a structured design exercise where you tackle a real-world design problem with specific constraints. Unlike traditional portfolio projects, whiteboard challenges mimic the problem-solving process you'll encounter in actual design roles and job interviews.</p>

            <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Whiteboard challenges are typically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time-boxed:</strong> Usually completed in 20-60 minutes, creating realistic pressure similar to interviews</li>
                <li><strong>Specific but open-ended:</strong> Clear enough to understand the scope, but flexible enough to demonstrate your thinking</li>
                <li><strong>Context-rich:</strong> Include details about the user, business, and constraints to guide your approach</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluative:</strong> Focused on your process, communication, and problem-solving approach, not just the final design</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why They Matter</h2>
            <p>Whiteboard challenges are an effective way to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Demonstrate your design thinking process</li>
                <li>Show how you handle ambiguity and make decisions under pressure</li>
                <li>Practice articulating your design reasoning</li>
                <li>Develop confidence in real-world design scenarios</li>
                <li>Build skills that transfer across different design domains</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Three Core Aspects</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Understanding the Problem</h3>
            <p>Before jumping to solutions, successful designers spend time understanding the problem space. This includes asking clarifying questions, identifying constraints, and defining the actual user need.</p>

            <h3>2. Developing Your Approach</h3>
            <p>With a clear understanding of the problem, you can develop a thoughtful approach. This might involve sketching, wireframing, or discussing your mental model of the solution.</p>

            <h3>3. Communicating Your Thinking</h3>
            <p>Perhaps the most important aspect is being able to articulate your reasoning. Interviewers care as much about how you think as they do about what you produce.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Whether you're preparing for interviews, training as a team, or looking to improve your design skills, whiteboard challenges provide a structured way to practice. Use Whiteboard Dojo to explore diverse challenges and refine your approach across different domains and difficulty levels.</p>
