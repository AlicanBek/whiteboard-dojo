            <p>The difference between teams that perform well under pressure and teams that don't often comes down to preparation. Great preparation removes surprises, builds confidence, and creates conditions for strong performance.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Challenge Communication</h2>

            <h3>Set Clear Expectations</h3>
            <p>Before the challenge day, ensure everyone understands:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What type of challenges will be given (branding, marketing, product-ux, or mix)</li>
                <li>Time frame for the challenge (typically 15-30 minutes)</li>
                <li>Format: individual or collaborative, observed or observed</li>
                <li>How solutions will be evaluated</li>
                <li>What happens after (feedback, scoring, next steps)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Discuss the Purpose</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Is this an assessment, learning opportunity, or hiring evaluation?</li>
                <li>How does this fit into bigger team/hiring goals?</li>
                <li>What will success look like?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Share Resources</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Point to examples of strong challenge solutions</li>
                <li>Share the whiteboard challenge fundamentals</li>
                <li>Provide links to preparation guides and practice materials</li>
                <li>Offer practice opportunities well in advance</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Physical and Environmental Preparation</h2>

            <h3>Whiteboard Setup</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure boards are clean and in good working condition</li>
                <li>Have multiple marker colors available (helps with visual organization)</li>
                <li>Test markers before the session (dried-out markers cause frustration)</li>
                <li>Have erasers or spray cleaner ready</li>
                <li>Leave at least one full board clean for the first challenge</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Space and Seating</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure the whiteboard is clearly visible from all seats</li>
                <li>Arrange seating so everyone can see and be seen (U-shape or open rectangle)</li>
                <li>Test sightlines: can everyone see the board and each other?</li>
                <li>Minimize distractions: quiet room, close unnecessary windows/doors</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technical Setup (for recorded sessions)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Test recording equipment well in advance</li>
                <li>Ensure camera angle captures both performer and whiteboard clearly</li>
                <li>Check audio quality: can you hear the performer clearly?</li>
                <li>Have backup recording device in case of technical failure</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Preparing Challenge Content</h2>

            <h3>Challenge Selection Criteria</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Appropriate for team's experience level (not too easy, not impossibly hard)</li>
                <li>Representative of real hiring challenges your company uses</li>
                <li>Varied types to test different thinking approaches</li>
                <li>Clear problem statements with minimal ambiguity</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenge Brief Preparation</h3>
            <p>For each challenge, prepare:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear problem statement (read aloud takes 30-60 seconds)</li>
                <li>Any clarifying information (company type, constraints, success metrics)</li>
                <li>Reference materials (competitor products, company background)</li>
                <li>Time frame and format expectations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Creating a Fair Challenge Environment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Give all participants the same information at the same time</li>
                <li>Don't answer questions differently for different people</li>
                <li>If someone asks a clarifying question, share the answer with the whole group</li>
                <li>Use the same time frame and success criteria for everyone</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It's normal to feel nervous. Acknowledge this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Most people find their heart racing a bit - that's normal and it passes"</li>
                <li>"Take a breath before you start, and remember to articulate your thinking"</li>
                <li>"There's no 'right answer' - we're evaluating your process, not your solution"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Building Confidence</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Remind people of their past successes and strengths</li>
                <li>Emphasize that you've all done the preparation work</li>
                <li>Frame this as an opportunity to show what they know, not a test they might fail</li>
                <li>Point out that everyone in the room has struggled with these challenges before</li>
            </ul>
