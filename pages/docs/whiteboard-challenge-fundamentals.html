            <p>Whiteboard challenges follow a consistent structure that allows you to demonstrate your design thinking. Understanding these fundamentals will help you approach any challenge with confidence.</p>

            <h2>The Challenge Structure</h2>
            <p>Every whiteboard challenge includes three essential components:</p>
            
            <h3>1. The Design Problem</h3>
            <p>This clearly states what you need to design. For example: "Design a login screen" or "Design a real-time collaboration system." The problem is specific enough to be clear but open-ended enough to allow for creative thinking.</p>

            <h3>2. The Context</h3>
            <p>This defines who the design is for and what success looks like. Understanding your user, their goals, and the business objectives is crucial to a strong solution.</p>

            <h3>3. The Constraints</h3>
            <p>Time is the primary constraint in whiteboard challenges, but others may include budget, technical limitations, or specific requirements. Constraints force prioritization and decision-making.</p>

            <h2>The Fundamentals of Great Solutions</h2>

            <h3>Ask Clarifying Questions</h3>
            <p>Start by asking questions about the problem. What's in scope? Who are the primary users? What metrics define success? This shows interviewers that you think systematically.</p>

            <h3>Focus on the User</h3>
            <p>Keep the user at the center of your thinking. Consider their goals, pain points, and context. A solution that serves the user well will also serve the business.</p>

            <h3>Make Your Assumptions Explicit</h3>
            <p>Since you're working with limited information, you'll need to make assumptions. State them clearly so your interviewer can guide you if needed.</p>

            <h3>Structure Your Approach</h3>
            <p>Use a framework like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the problem and constraints</li>
                <li>Define the user and their needs</li>
                <li>Identify key flows and interactions</li>
                <li>Sketch or describe your solution</li>
                <li>Consider edge cases and alternative approaches</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Communicate as You Go</h3>
            <p>Don't work silently. Walk your interviewer through your thinking. Explain your decisions. Ask for feedback. This is as important as the solution itself.</p>

            <h2>Time Management</h2>
            <p>Most whiteboard challenges have a 20-60 minute timeframe. Allocate your time thoughtfully:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>5-10 minutes:</strong> Understand the problem, ask clarifying questions</li>
                <li><strong>5-10 minutes:</strong> Define your approach and identify key flows</li>
                <li><strong>10-30 minutes:</strong> Sketch or describe your solution</li>
                <li><strong>5-10 minutes:</strong> Discuss alternative approaches and edge cases</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Practice Regularly</h2>
            <p>Like any skill, whiteboard challenges improve with practice. The more you do them, the more naturally the process becomes. Use Whiteboard Dojo to practice different challenge types and build your confidence.</p>
