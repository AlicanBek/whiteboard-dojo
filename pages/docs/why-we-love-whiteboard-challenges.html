            <p>Whiteboard challenges have become a staple in design interviews and team development for good reason. They offer a unique window into how someone approaches problems, communicates ideas, and handles pressure.</p>

            <h2>They Reveal Your Design Process</h2>
            <p>A whiteboard challenge isn't about creating a perfect design artifact—it's about showcasing how you think. Interviewers and team leads get to see:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How you clarify ambiguous requirements</li>
                <li>What design principles guide your decisions</li>
                <li>How you prioritize conflicting needs</li>
                <li>Whether you consider edge cases and accessibility</li>
                <li>How you gather feedback and iterate</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>They Build Practical Skills</h2>
            <p>Unlike portfolio projects with unlimited time, whiteboard challenges force you to develop:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rapid decision-making:</strong> Making good decisions quickly under constraints</li>
                <li><strong>Clear communication:</strong> Explaining your thinking in real-time</li>
                <li><strong>Problem-solving:</strong> Breaking down complex challenges into manageable pieces</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Adjusting your approach based on feedback</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>They Level the Playing Field</h2>
            <p>Unlike portfolio reviews, which can be influenced by budget, team size, or resources, whiteboard challenges are equalizers. Every candidate or team member faces the same constraints and same amount of time. Success depends on thinking, not production value.</p>

            <h2>They're Invaluable for Interviews</h2>
            <p>Design interviews increasingly include whiteboard challenges because they:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce bias in hiring by focusing on thinking over aesthetics</li>
                <li>Allow for real-time feedback and discussion</li>
                <li>Simulate actual day-to-day design work better than portfolio reviews</li>
                <li>Help both interviewer and candidate assess fit</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>They Drive Team Growth</h2>
            <p>For teams, whiteboard challenges provide:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A structured way to practice together</li>
                <li>Opportunities to learn from different perspectives</li>
                <li>Shared language and vocabulary around design thinking</li>
                <li>A low-stakes environment for experimentation and failure</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Start Your Practice Today</h2>
            <p>Whether you're preparing for interviews, developing as a designer, or leading a team, whiteboard challenges are a powerful tool for growth. Use Whiteboard Dojo to practice regularly and build the confidence and skills you need to excel.</p>
