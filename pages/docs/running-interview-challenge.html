        <div class="doc-content">
            <p>The way you run a whiteboard challenge impacts the candidate's performance and your ability to assess them fairly. It's the difference between getting a clear picture of someone's abilities and getting a stress-induced performance that doesn't reflect their actual capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Interview Setup and Logistics</h2>

            <h3>Physical Space (In-Person)</h3>

            <h4>Essential Elements:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Whiteboard or writing surface:</strong> Large enough to work comfortably; full board is ideal</li>
                <li><strong>Markers:</strong> Multiple colors (at least 3-4), all working with bold color</li>
                <li><strong>Eraser or cleaner:</strong> Ready if they need to clear space</li>
                <li><strong>Seating:</strong> Chair that allows them to stand and work comfortably</li>
                <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Everyone can see the board clearly</li>
                <li><strong>Quiet:</strong> Minimal distractions or interruptions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Virtual Space (Remote)</h3>

            <h4>Technical Setup:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Test whiteboarding software beforehand (Miro, Figma, Google Jamboard, etc.)</li>
                <li>Ensure screen sharing works smoothly</li>
                <li>Have a backup tool in case of technical failure</li>
                <li>Test audio/video quality</li>
                <li>Send whiteboarding tool link and instructions ahead of time</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Considerations:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Virtual whiteboarding can feel more stilted; be extra warm and encouraging</li>
                <li>Candidate can't stand and move as freely; be patient if they seem uncomfortable</li>
                <li>Screen sharing sometimes lags; give them time to catch up</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Before the Challenge Begins (10 minutes early)</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Greet candidate warmly</li>
                <li>Small talk to help them relax: "How was your morning?" "Found parking okay?"</li>
                <li>Offer water, coffee, restroom</li>
                <li>Mention it's okay to ask questions</li>
                <li>Explain the timing: "You'll have 25 minutes for the challenge, then we'll discuss"</li>
                <li>Brief on how you'll facilitate: "I'll watch and take notes. Feel free to think out loud"</li>
                <li>Ask if they have any questions before starting</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenge Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h2>

            <h3>Reading the Brief</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Read the brief clearly and completely</li>
                <li>Read it at a pace they can follow (not too fast)</li>
                <li>Don't ad-lib or change the challenge mid-read</li>
                <li>Pause at the end so they can process</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Opening Questions</h3>

            <p>"Do you have any clarifying questions before you start?" Wait for questions. Answer them directly and clearly. Don't use questions as a test ("What do you think we should focus on?"). Just answer.</p>

            <h3>Starting the Clock</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>"You have [time] for the challenge. Let's start now."</li>
                <li>Start your timer visibly or mention when they have X minutes left</li>
                <li>Be consistent about time warnings (some people appreciate "5 minutes left" warnings; some don't)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>During the Challenge</h2>

            <h3>Your Role: Observer, Not Facilitator</h3>

            <p>Your job is to observe their process, not to help or guide them. This is hard—resist the urge to help.</p>

            <h4>Do:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Watch attentively and take notes</li>
                <li>Note the time spent on different phases</li>
                <li>Observe their approach and decision-making process</li>
                <li>Listen to how they articulate their thinking</li>
                <li>Note moments of hesitation or uncertainty</li>
                <li>Stay quiet and let them think (silence is okay)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Don't:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Suggest ideas or approaches</li>
                <li>Offer affirmation ("Great idea!") that influences their thinking</li>
                <li>Ask them to hurry or slow down (let them self-manage)</li>
                <li>Distract them with your own work or phone</li>
                <li>Offer unnecessary information beyond the brief</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>If They Ask Questions During the Challenge</h3>

            <h4>Clarifying Questions (Legitimate):</h4>
            <p>Candidate: "Can I assume the target user is desktop or mobile?" or "Is there a specific budget constraint?"</p>

            <p><strong>Answer directly:</strong> "Either is fine" or "No specific budget constraint."</p>

            <h4>Help-Seeking Questions (Don't answer these):</h4>
            <p>Candidate: "Should I focus on the UI or the flow?" or "What do you think about this direction?"</p>

            <p><strong>Respond:</strong> "That's up to you—whatever you think makes sense" or "Whatever direction you want to go, I'm interested to see your thinking."</p>

            <h3>When They Get Stuck</h3>

            <p>It's normal. Silence is okay. Struggling is okay. Don't rescue them.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>If they explicitly ask for help: "What are you uncertain about?"</li>
                <li>Let them work through it</li>
                <li>Don't offer suggestions unless they directly ask</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>If They Run Over Time</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Give a 5-minute warning if they haven't already noticed the time</li>
                <li>At time, say: "Time's up. Let me ask you to wrap up in the next 30 seconds"</li>
                <li>Don't let them continue significantly past time (it becomes unfair to compare)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What to Observe and Note</h2>

            <h3>Problem Analysis Phase</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Do they start by asking clarifying questions or asking you to repeat?</li>
                <li>Do they immediately write down key constraints and goals?</li>
                <li>How do they organize information?</li>
                <li>Do they identify user groups? Research needs?</li>
                <li>Time spent on this phase (ideal: 3-5 minutes)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Research/Discovery Phase</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Do they discuss understanding the user context/needs?</li>
                <li>Do they consider competitive solutions?</li>
                <li>How systematic is their thinking?</li>
                <li>Time spent (ideal: 3-5 minutes)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ideation Phase</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Do they sketch or talk through multiple ideas?</li>
                <li>How many concepts do they explore?</li>
                <li>Do they evaluate trade-offs or just pick the first idea?</li>
                <li>Time spent (ideal: 5-8 minutes)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Solution Development</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Are they going deep on their chosen direction?</li>
                <li>Are they considering details and edge cases?</li>
                <li>How thorough is their thinking?</li>
                <li>Time spent (ideal: 7-12 minutes)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Communication Throughout</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>How clearly are they explaining their thinking?</li>
                <li>Do they check in with you ("Does this make sense?") or just proceed?</li>
                <li>How comfortable do they seem?</li>
                <li>Are they thinking out loud or silently?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Responsive Facilitation</h2>

            <h3>Handling Major Misunderstandings</h3>

            <p>If candidate is clearly solving the wrong problem:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Let them work for a few minutes if possible (gives you data on how they approach things)</li>
                <li>Gently clarify: "Just to check—by 'improve the booking experience,' did you understand we meant for new users?"</li>
                <li>Let them course-correct</li>
                <li>Don't penalize them for a clarification question they should have asked</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Handling Off-Track Thinking</h3>

            <p>Sometimes candidates go in unusual directions. That's okay. Let them explore. You might learn something interesting about their thinking.</p>

            <h3>If They Finish Early</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Ask: "Do you feel like you're done, or is there more you'd like to develop?"</li>
                <li>If they're truly done, let them be done (don't pressure them to fill time)</li>
                <li>You'll have more time for discussion</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Final Presentation</h2>

            <h3>Asking Them to Walk Through Their Solution</h3>

            <p>At the end of time: "Walk me through what you came up with."</p>

            <p>Let them explain their solution. This is part of the assessment—how clearly can they communicate their work?</p>

            <h4>Do:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Listen actively</li>
                <li>Let them finish their explanation before asking questions</li>
                <li>Take notes on key points and articulation quality</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Don't:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Interrupt or correct them</li>
                <li>Offer critique yet</li>
                <li>Suggest better ideas</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Discussion and Follow-Up Questions (5-10 minutes)</h2>

            <h3>Clarifying Your Understanding</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>"Tell me more about why you chose this approach over other options"</li>
                <li>"How would this work for [different user type]?"</li>
                <li>"What would you do differently if [new constraint]?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Exploring Their Thinking</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>"What was the hardest part of this challenge?"</li>
                <li>"If you had more time, what would you change?"</li>
                <li>"How would you validate whether this works?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Assessing Flexibility</h3>

            <p>Present a new constraint or question and see how they respond:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>"What if we learned that our main user group was on mobile, not desktop?"</li>
                <li>"One stakeholder thinks we should prioritize X instead of Y. How would you respond?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Feedback in the Moment</h3>

            <p>You don't need to give detailed feedback during the interview. A simple closing works:</p>

            <p>"Thank you for working through that thoughtfully. We'll take some time to review and get back to you with feedback."</p>

            <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Explain what happens next: "We'll review your work and be in touch by [date]"</li>
                <li>Thank them for their time</li>
                <li>Be warm—they put themselves out there</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Immediate Post-Challenge Notes</h3>

            <p>Within 15 minutes of the interview, while it's fresh:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Write down key observations</li>
                <li>Note specific strengths and growth areas</li>
                <li>Score on your assessment rubric</li>
                <li>Capture quotes or specific moments that stood out</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Remember</h3>

            <p>Your job running the challenge is to create an environment where someone can do their best thinking, observe their process fairly, and document what you learned. A candidate's performance in a whiteboard challenge is one data point in hiring. Combined with portfolio review, interviews, and references, it helps you make a stronger decision.</p>
