            <p>Whiteboard challenge success isn't about innate talent. It's about deliberate practice focused on the specific skills that matter. The best performers treat these challenges like any other professional skill: learning systematically, practicing intentionally, and measuring progress rigorously.</p>

            <h2>The Skill Pyramid for Whiteboard Challenges</h2>

            <h3>Foundation Level: Core Design Thinking (Weeks 1-4)</h3>
            <p>Start with the fundamentals. You need to be able to think through design problems systematically before you can do it under pressure.</p>

                <li>Identifying users and their needs</li>
                <li>Mapping constraints and priorities</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Practice Approach:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Work through challenges at your own pace with no timer</li>
                <li>Write down your questions before starting</li>
                <li>Sketch multiple user scenarios for each problem</li>
                <li>Document your assumptions explicitly</li>
                <li>Take 20 minutes to understand the problem before proposing solutions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Intermediate Level: Efficient Execution (Weeks 5-12)</h3>

                <li>Build in statements like "I'm assuming X, but we could explore Y instead" to show flexibility</li>
                <li>Practice acknowledging valid criticism and incorporating it into your solution</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Building Visual Communication</h2>

            <h3>Sketching for Speed and Clarity</h3>
            <p>Your drawings don't need to be beautiful. They need to communicate ideas quickly and clearly.</p>

            <h4>Practice Techniques:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Set a timer for 5 minutes and sketch a user flow for a familiar app</li>
                <li>Practice drawing common UI patterns (navigation, forms, cards, feeds) repeatedly</li>
                <li>Use simple shapes and labels rather than detailed illustrations</li>
                <li>Learn to draw on a grid to create alignment and proportion quickly</li>
                <li>Practice annotating sketches with callouts explaining your thinking</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Using Whitespace and Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn basic design principles: contrast, alignment, proximity, repetition</li>
                <li>Practice organizing information hierarchically (title → sections → details)</li>
                <li>Use consistent sizing and spacing to show relationships between ideas</li>
                <li>Study how others use the whiteboard in challenge recordings or videos</li>
            </ul>
