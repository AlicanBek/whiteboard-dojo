            <p>Team practice sessions create space for collaborative problem-solving, knowledge-sharing, and mutual growth. Done well, they strengthen team culture while building interview readiness. Done poorly, they become uncomfortable theater that nobody enjoys.</p>

            <h2>Why Team Practice Sessions Work</h2>

            <h3>Learning From Others</h3>
            <p>You learn as much by observing others' thinking as you do from practicing yourself. Watching teammates approach problems differently reveals alternative frameworks and new techniques.</p>

            <h3>Building Psychological Safety</h3>
            <p>Practicing together normalizes struggling and vulnerability. This builds the psychological safety teams need to do their best work and take creative risks.</p>

            <h3>Strengthening Team Dynamics</h3>
            <p>Collaborative challenges reveal how teammates think and approach problems. This builds empathy and strengthens relationships.</p>

            <h2>Setting Up Effective Team Sessions</h2>

            <h3>Logistics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 60-90 minutes including challenge, review, and discussion</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Weekly or bi-weekly depending on team needs</li>
                <li><strong>Group size:</strong> 4-8 people optimal (larger groups become hard to manage)</li>
                <li><strong>Setting:</strong> Large whiteboard or digital whiteboarding tool, quiet space where everyone can see and hear</li>
                <li><strong>Recording:</strong> If possible, record sessions for review and knowledge-sharing with those who couldn't attend</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenge Selection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose challenges appropriate for your team's experience level</li>
                <li>Mix challenge types to keep sessions fresh and engaging</li>
                <li>Vary difficulty to give everyone opportunities to stretch and succeed</li>
                <li>Consider upcoming interviews or hiring needs when selecting challenges</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Time Allocation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduce challenge and context: 2-3 minutes</li>
                <li>Perform challenge (observer taking notes): 20-30 minutes</li>
                <li>Break and preparation for feedback: 2-3 minutes</li>
                <li>Facilitator feedback and discussion: 15-20 minutes</li>
                <li>Peer feedback and questions: 15-20 minutes</li>
                <li>Wrap-up and key learnings: 5-10 minutes</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Team Challenge Format</h2>

            <h3>Participant Rotation</h3>
            <p>One person performs the challenge while others observe. Rotate to give everyone practice opportunities and the chance to observe different approaches.</p>

            <h3>Setting Expectations</h3>
            <p>Before starting, remind participants:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is practice, not a test</li>
                <li>Struggling is expected and valuable</li>
                <li>Observers should be supportive, not judgmental</li>
                <li>The goal is learning, not perfection</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Observer Role</h3>
            <p>Assign one person to take notes on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Questions asked during problem analysis</li>
                <li>Assumptions identified and stated</li>
                <li>Research approach and key insights</li>
                <li>Solution concepts generated</li>
                <li>Final solution and key decisions</li>
                <li>Communication effectiveness (clarity, pacing, technical language use)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Facilitating Productive Feedback</h2>

            <h3>The Feedback Framework</h3>

            <h4>Step 1: Participant Self-Assessment</h4>
            <p>Ask the performer: "How do you think that went? What did you do well? What would you do differently?"</p>

            <h4>Step 2: Facilitator Feedback</h4>
            <p>Lead with strengths and specific observations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"You asked great clarifying questions about the time commitment for users"</li>
                <li>"Your user research was comprehensive - you considered three distinct user types"</li>
                <li>"I noticed you spent 10 minutes on problem analysis and jumped quickly to solutions"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Step 3: Peer Feedback</h4>
            <p>Coach peers to offer constructive, specific feedback:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encourage them to identify one thing they'll copy from the approach</li>
                <li>Ask "What would you have done differently here?"</li>
                <li>Foster discussion: "Did anyone notice X?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Feedback Do's and Don'ts</h3>

            <h4>Do:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Be specific: "Your sketches made the layout hierarchy clear" vs. "Good sketches"</li>
                <li>Balance positive with developmental: Acknowledge what worked before suggesting improvements</li>
                <li>Focus on process, not just solution: "How you approached the problem" matters as much as "what you created"</li>
                <li>Ask questions: "Why did you focus on X first?" opens discussion rather than dictating</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Don't:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Make it personal: Critique the approach, not the person</li>
                <li>Over-index on solution quality: The journey matters more than the destination</li>
                <li>Dominate the feedback: Facilitators should ask questions and guide, not deliver monologues</li>
                <li>Create hierarchy: Avoid suggesting some ideas are "right" and others "wrong"</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Session Variations</h2>

            <h3>Paired Challenge</h3>
            <p>Two people work through a challenge together while the group observes. This reveals collaboration skills and how people negotiate and make decisions together.</p>

            <h3>Consecutive Challenges</h3>
            <p>Two performers tackle the same challenge separately (back-to-back, without watching each other). Compare and contrast their approaches to show how the same problem can have multiple good solutions.</p>

            <h3>Hot Seat</h3>
            <p>Observers ask challenging questions throughout the process. This prepares people for real interview situations where interviewers actively engage and challenge thinking.</p>

            <h3>Fishbowl</h3>
            <p>Divide the group in half. One group performs challenges while the other observes and takes notes, then swap roles. This gives everyone equal practice and observation time.</p>

            <h2>Building Strong Team Culture Around Practice</h2>

            <h3>Creating Psychological Safety</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Leaders and experienced designers should go first to model vulnerability</li>
                <li>Explicitly normalize struggling and uncertainty</li>
                <li>Thank people for trying and learning, regardless of solution quality</li>
                <li>Address any dismissive comments immediately and privately</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Making It Sustainable</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep sessions to a consistent day and time so people can plan around them</li>
                <li>Track and share improvement over months to show progress</li>
                <li>Celebrate learning moments, not just solutions</li>
                <li>Connect practice directly to hiring outcomes to show impact</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Handling Varied Participation Levels</h3>
            <p>Some team members will be eager, others reluctant. Strategies for increasing engagement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Emphasize that whiteboard challenges are a core professional skill everyone needs</li>
                <li>Start with lower-pressure formats (no recording, smaller groups) to build comfort</li>
                <li>Pair nervous participants with supportive observers</li>
                <li>Frame this as team investment, not performance evaluation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Documenting and Scaling Learning</h2>

            <h3>Session Documentation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Record each session (with participants' permission) for those who couldn't attend</li>
                <li>Capture the challenge, approaches taken, and key feedback in a shared document</li>
                <li>Highlight interesting decisions and techniques for team learning</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Building Institutional Knowledge</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Share recordings and notes with broader team/company</li>
                <li>Create a repository of common mistakes and strong approaches</li>
                <li>Use team sessions to onboard new designers to your problem-solving culture</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The teams that interview best are those that practice together, learn from each other, and build a shared vocabulary and culture around design thinking. Regular whiteboard practice sessions are one of the most effective ways to build this.</p>
