        <div class="doc-content">
            <p>Whiteboard Dojo exists because the design community needs better tools for practice, hiring, and learning. It was built from nearly a decade of experience running whiteboard challenges—seeing what works, what doesn't, and how designers can best prepare and perform.</p>

            <p>But Whiteboard Dojo is incomplete without the community. The best challenges, the most useful resources, and the strongest vision for this tool come from people like you who use it, think about it, and want to make it better.</p>

            <h2>How You Can Contribute</h2>

            <h3>Share Your Challenges</h3>

            <p>Have a whiteboard challenge that's worked well in your interviews? Or a problem you'd like to see turned into a challenge? Share it.</p>

            <h4>What Makes a Good Challenge?</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Clear and specific problem statement</li>
                <li>Appropriate scope for 15-30 minutes</li>
                <li>Tests core design thinking skills</li>
                <li>Fair across different design backgrounds</li>
                <li>Has been tried with at least 3-5 people</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What to Include:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>The challenge brief (what you say to the candidate)</li>
                <li>Difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)</li>
                <li>Type (branding, marketing, product-ux, or other)</li>
                <li>Time frame (15, 20, 25, 30 minutes)</li>
                <li>What you're assessing ("I created this to see how candidates approach research and prioritization")</li>
                <li>Any notes on how it's been received ("Candidates often get stuck on X" or "Usually generates interesting conversations about Y")</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Share Resources and Tools</h3>

            <p>Have assessment rubrics, interview guides, or feedback templates that work well? Have templates for tracking candidate performance? Have checklists for preparing team practice sessions?</p>

            <p>These practical tools help the whole community conduct better interviews and practice sessions.</p>

            <h3>Write Articles and Guides</h3>

            <p>Is there something important about whiteboard challenges that isn't covered in our docs? A topic like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Whiteboard challenges in specific design domains (interaction design, service design, design systems)</li>
                <li>How to prepare for challenges with specific types of roles or companies</li>
                <li>How to teach whiteboard challenge skills to junior designers</li>
                <li>How different companies approach whiteboard challenges differently</li>
                <li>Accessibility and inclusion in whiteboard challenges</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Write about it. Help the community learn from your perspective and experience.</p>

            <h3>Share Interview Stories</h3>

            <p>What was your whiteboard challenge experience like? What did you learn? What would you do differently?</p>

            <p>Stories help people feel less alone and more prepared. They reveal the human side of these challenges and often contain practical lessons.</p>

            <h3>Report Bugs and Suggest Features</h3>

            <p>Is something broken in the Dojo tool? Did you encounter a challenge that was confusing? Have an idea for a feature that would make practice better?</p>

            <p>Let us know. The best products are shaped by people actually using them and telling us what they need.</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>Attribution and Recognition</h3>

            <h3>Feedback and Iteration</h3>

            <p>We don't just accept submissions; we partner with contributors:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>We provide feedback and suggestions for improvement</li>
                <li>We iterate together to make contributions stronger</li>
                <li>We stay in touch as resources evolve</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Community Standards</h2>

            <p>We ask that all contributions reflect these principles:</p>

            <h3>Quality</h3>

            <p>Contributions should be thoughtful, well-written, and represent solid thinking about whiteboard challenges.</p>

            <h3>Inclusivity</h3>

            <p>Challenges and resources should be accessible to designers from different backgrounds, experience levels, and perspectives.</p>

            <h3>Fairness</h3>

            <p>Challenges should be designed to be fair assessments of capability, not gatekeeping or testing for specific experience.</p>

            <h3>Generosity</h3>

            <p>We contribute because we believe in making the design community stronger, not for personal gain or recognition.</p>

            <h3>Respect</h3>

            <p>We treat each other, and people's different approaches to whiteboard challenges, with respect.</p>

            <h2>The Bigger Vision</h2>

            <p>Here's what we're building toward:</p>

            <h3>A Resource That Grows With the Community</h3>

            <p>Whiteboard Dojo shouldn't be static. As the design industry evolves, as new types of challenges emerge, as we learn what works—the resource should evolve too. That happens through contributions.</p>

            <h3>Standardization and Best Practices</h3>

            <p>Right now, whiteboard challenges vary wildly. Some companies use them fairly, others less so. Some focus on the right skills, others don't. By building shared resources and standards, we raise the quality across the industry.</p>

            <h3>Reducing Stress and Increasing Fairness</h3>

            <p>Preparation reduces anxiety. Good resources help people know what to expect, how to practice, and what's being assessed. Better standardization and community sharing make the process fairer.</p>

            <h3>Building a Stronger Design Community</h3>

            <p>When designers practice together, learn from each other, and share their knowledge, the whole community gets stronger. This benefits everyone from students just starting out to senior leaders building their organizations.</p>

            <h2>Thank You</h2>

            <p>If you're reading this, you care about design, about growth, and about building a stronger community. That's exactly the kind of person we need.</p>

            <p>Whether you contribute challenges, resources, feedback, or just use Whiteboard Dojo and tell friends about it—thank you. You're making this better.</p>

            <p>Let's build something great together.</p>
