        <div class="doc-content">
            <p>For hiring and promotions, whiteboard challenges provide valuable assessment data. But only if you have a clear, fair framework for evaluation. Gut feelings and overall impressions can lead to biased decisions. Structured assessment helps you evaluate candidates consistently and defend your hiring decisions.</p>

            <h2>Assessment Framework</h2>

            <h3>Core Evaluation Dimensions</h3>

            <h4>1. Problem Comprehension (20%)</h4>
            <p>Did they understand the problem deeply and ask good questions?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exceptional:</strong> Asked insightful questions that revealed deep understanding of users, business, and constraints</li>
                <li><strong>Strong:</strong> Asked good clarifying questions; clearly understood the problem scope</li>
                <li><strong>Adequate:</strong> Understood the core problem; asked a few clarifying questions</li>
                <li><strong>Weak:</strong> Jumped to solution without clarifying the problem</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Research and Discovery (15%)</h4>
            <p>Did they take time to understand users and context?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exceptional:</strong> Deeply researched user needs; identified competing solutions; thought about diverse user scenarios</li>
                <li><strong>Strong:</strong> Identified primary users; considered their needs; thought about context</li>
                <li><strong>Adequate:</strong> Identified users; spent appropriate time on research</li>
                <li><strong>Weak:</strong> Minimal research; jumped straight to solution</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Ideation and Exploration (15%)</h4>
            <p>Did they generate multiple ideas and think creatively?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exceptional:</strong> Multiple distinct solution approaches; novel ideas; thoughtful trade-off analysis</li>
                <li><strong>Strong:</strong> 2-3 solution concepts; good rationale for choosing between them</li>
                <li><strong>Adequate:</strong> Single clear solution with some consideration of alternatives</li>
                <li><strong>Weak:</strong> Single idea, minimal exploration</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Solution Quality (20%)</h4>
            <p>Is the final solution appropriate for the problem?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exceptional:</strong> Comprehensive solution addressing core problem; thoughtful details; strong rationale</li>
                <li><strong>Strong:</strong> Clear solution addressing main problem; good design decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Adequate:</strong> Solution addresses the problem; reasonable approach</li>
                <li><strong>Weak:</strong> Solution incomplete or doesn't address core problem</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>5. Communication (20%)</h4>
            <p>Did they articulate their thinking clearly and confidently?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exceptional:</strong> Articulate and confident; clear explanation of rationale; good use of design vocabulary</li>
                <li><strong>Strong:</strong> Clear communication; easy to follow thinking; confident delivery</li>
                <li><strong>Adequate:</strong> Generally clear; thinking is understandable though perhaps not polished</li>
                <li><strong>Weak:</strong> Difficult to follow; unclear explanations; lacks confidence</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Weights and Total Score</h3>
            <p>Your final assessment might look like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem Comprehension (20%) × Score = __</li>
                <li>Research & Discovery (15%) × Score = __</li>
                <li>Ideation & Exploration (15%) × Score = __</li>
                <li>Solution Quality (20%) × Score = __</li>
                <li>Communication (20%) × Score = __</li>
                <li><strong>Total Score = __</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can adjust weights based on what matters most for your role. For user-facing design, communication might be weighted higher. For strategic product roles, solution quality and research might be emphasized.</p>

            <h2>Assessment Methodologies</h2>

            <h3>Individual Assessment</h3>
            <p>One person watches the challenge and scores afterward:</p>

            <h4>Pros:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Quick and efficient</li>
                <li>Clear accountability for the assessment</li>
                <li>Consistent from one candidate to the next</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Cons:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Single perspective can miss important details</li>
                <li>Personal biases can influence assessment</li>
                <li>Less defensible in case of questions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Panel Assessment</h3>
            <p>Multiple people watch and score independently, then discuss:</p>

            <h4>Pros:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple perspectives catch different strengths and weaknesses</li>
                <li>Discussion creates richer feedback</li>
                <li>More defensible hiring decision</li>
                <li>Reduces individual bias</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Cons:</h4>
                <li>Takes more time and coordination</li>
                <li>Groupthink can occur if not careful about discussion facilitation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Best Practice: Structured Panel Assessment</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Each panelist scores independently (don't discuss before scoring)</li>
                <li>Share scores and see if there's consensus</li>
                <li>If scores differ significantly (e.g., 3/5 vs 5/5), discuss why</li>
                <li>Reach consensus or document disagreement</li>
                <li>Write assessment notes</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Calibration and Consistency</h2>

            <h3>The Calibration Meeting</h3>
            <p>Before evaluating candidates, run calibration sessions with your assessment panel:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Watch a recorded challenge together</li>
                <li>Each person scores independently</li>
                <li>Discuss any significant differences</li>
                <li>Align on what each rating level means</li>
                <li>Repeat with 2-3 examples until consistency improves</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Anchoring Examples</h3>
            <p>Build a library of reference examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"This is a 5/5 for problem comprehension: asked deep questions about..."</li>
                <li>"This is a 3/5 for communication: clear enough to understand but could be more polished"</li>
                <li>Use these examples when new panelists join or when scores diverge</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Avoiding Common Assessment Biases</h2>

            <h3>First Impression Bias</h3>
            <p>Someone's strong start can color your entire assessment.</p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Score each dimension independently; don't let strong problem comprehension inflate your solution quality rating</p>

            <h3>Halo Effect</h3>
            <p>Someone who communicates well might seem smarter overall than they are.</p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Focus on process and specific decisions, not overall impression; weight solution quality separately from communication</p>

            <h3>Contrast Bias</h3>
            <p>You rate someone differently based on other candidates you've seen that day.</p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Use absolute scoring scales, not relative to other candidates; compare to your established standards, not to the last person</p>

            <h3>Affinity Bias</h3>
            <p>You favor people similar to you (background, thinking style, communication style).</p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Use structured rubrics; have diverse panelists; discuss when scores diverge significantly</p>

            <h3>Confirmation Bias</h3>
            <p>You unconsciously look for evidence supporting an initial impression.</p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Score independently before discussion; ask: "What did this person do well?" not "Were they good?"</p>

            <h2>Decision-Making Framework</h2>

            <h3>For Hiring</h3>

            <h4>Strong Hire (Score 4.5-5)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Exceptional across most dimensions</li>
                <li>Clear readiness for the role</li>
                <li>Can handle the challenges of the position</li>
                <li><strong>Decision:</strong> Hire</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Hire (Score 4-4.4)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Strong across all dimensions</li>
                <li>Ready for the role with appropriate support</li>
                <li>Some growth areas but solid foundation</li>
                <li><strong>Decision:</strong> Hire</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Maybe/Borderline (Score 3-3.9)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Mixed results across dimensions</li>
                <li>Strong in some areas, weak in others</li>
                <li>Could succeed with significant coaching or could struggle</li>
                <li><strong>Decision:</strong> Discuss further; consider other factors; may not clear bar</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Don't Hire (Score below 3)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Weak across multiple dimensions</li>
                <li>Significant gaps relative to role requirements</li>
                <li>Unclear if coaching would address core gaps</li>
                <li><strong>Decision:</strong> Don't hire</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For Promotions</h3>

            <p>For promotion decisions, consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Current job performance (most important)</li>
                <li>Whiteboard challenge results (supporting data)</li>
                <li>Feedback from managers and peers</li>
                <li>Growth trajectory and potential</li>
            </ul>

            <p>An exceptional whiteboard result reinforces readiness for a new role. A weaker result isn't necessarily disqualifying—it might indicate an area for development rather than a blocker to promotion.</p>

            <h2>Documentation and Record-Keeping</h2>

            <h3>What to Document</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Challenge presented and date</li>
                <li>Panelists involved in assessment</li>
                <li>Scores on each dimension</li>
                <li>Key strengths observed</li>
                <li>Growth areas identified</li>
                <li>Overall recommendation and rationale</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Defensibility if decisions are questioned</li>
                <li>Continuity if roles or panelists change</li>
                <li>Tracking patterns: who scores well, who needs development</li>
                <li>Learning: what assessment approaches work best</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Feedback and Growth Conversations</h2>

            <h3>Sharing Results</h3>
            <p>Whether hiring or promoting, share results thoughtfully:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lead with strengths and positive observations</li>
                <li>Be specific: "Your research on user needs was particularly strong" not "Good job overall"</li>
                <li>Identify 1-2 growth areas, not a laundry list</li>
                <li>Offer concrete suggestions for development</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Separating Feedback from Decisions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you're not hiring: feedback is about growth, not explaining rejection</li>
                <li>If you are hiring: feedback is about what to develop in the new role</li>
                <li>If promoting: feedback is about areas to focus on in expanded role</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Assessment should feel fair, clear, and focused on helping people understand their strengths and growth opportunities. When it does, candidates have confidence in the process even if decisions don't go their way.</p>
